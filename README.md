Something I created for myself, but I think it'll be useful for students like me who rely on flashcards. :)

Simple
Reliable
And keeps reminding you to study :P


**What you can do:**
*   **Create Decks**: Group your cards by topic (e.g., "History", "Spanish").
*   **Study**: Flip through cards at your own pace.
*   **Quiz**: Test yourself with multiple-choice questions.
*   **Schedule**: Set a reminder in your Google Calendar to study tomorrow.

That's it! No complicated setup. Just login and start learning and scoring better.


Instead of scrolling on your phone(like I do)


**Features to add**
* Spaced Repition Scheduling
* Pomodoro Timer
* Automatic Flashcard Maker from PDF,PPT,Images,Text
